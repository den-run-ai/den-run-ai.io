Such symmetry often hints at potential strategies for finding solutions, as it allows us to assume certain relationships between the variables without loss of generality. The solution below is generated by OpenAI O1-mini reasoning LLM system by using the following prompt. No other model AI or LLM is able to solve this problem! ‚ÄúSolve for integers, use techniques from solved Diophantine equations:\na/(b+c) + b/(a+c) + c/(a+b) = 4 ‚Äù\n Figure 1: The symmetrical Diophantine equation under consideration."

    "text": "Breaking Down the Problem\nTo tackle this equation, we‚Äôll employ techniques commonly used in solving DE, such as symmetry exploitation, substitution, and systematic trial and error.\n\nStep 1: Leveraging Symmetry\nGiven the equation‚Äôs symmetry, we can assume, without loss of generality, that one of the variables is negative.\n\n\nStep 2: Introducing Substitution\nLet‚Äôs assume ( c = -k ), where ( k ) is a positive integer. Substituting this into our original equation transforms it into:\n\\(\\frac{a}{b - k} + \\frac{b}{a - k} - \\frac{k}{a + b} = 4\\)\nThis substitution simplifies the problem by reducing the number of negative terms, making it easier to handle the equation‚Äôs balance.\n\n\nStep 3: Systematic Trial and Error\nWith ( c = -k ), we now seek positive integers ( a ) and ( b ) such that ( a &gt; k ) and ( b &gt; k ) to avoid division by zero or negative denominators. Through systematic trial, varying ( k ) and solving for ( a ) and ( b ), we aim to satisfy the equation.\n\nDiscovering the Solution: ( (a, b, c) = (9, 11, -5) )\nIt appears O1-mini applied some threshold analysis to find pairs that sum to nearly 4, but without providing any details.\nThrough diligent testing, one solution stands out:\n\nCase ( k = 5 ):\n\nLet ( a = 9 ) and ( b = 11 ).\n\nSubstituting these values:\n(9 / (11 - 5)) + (11 / (9 - 5)) - (5 / (9 + 11)) = (9 / 6) + (11 / 4) - (5 / 20) = 1.5 + 2.75 - 0.25 = 4.0\nThe equation holds true, confirming that ( (9, 11, -5) ) is a valid solution."
