    "text": "Breaking Down the Problem\nTo tackle this equation, we‚Äôll employ techniques commonly used in solving DE, such as symmetry exploitation, substitution, and systematic trial and error.\n\nStep 1: Leveraging Symmetry\nGiven the equation‚Äôs symmetry, we can assume, without loss of generality, that one of the variables is negative.\n\n\nStep 2: Introducing Substitution\nLet‚Äôs assume ( c = -k ), where ( k ) is a positive integer. Substituting this into our original equation transforms it into:\n\\(\\frac{a}{b - k} + \\frac{b}{a - k} - \\frac{k}{a + b} = 4\\)\nThis substitution simplifies the problem by reducing the number of negative terms, making it easier to handle the equation‚Äôs balance.\n\n\nStep 3: Systematic Trial and Error\nWith ( c = -k ), we now seek positive integers ( a ) and ( b ) such that ( a &gt; k ) and ( b &gt; k ) to avoid division by zero or negative denominators. Through systematic trial, varying ( k ) and solving for ( a ) and ( b ), we aim to satisfy the equation.\n\nDiscovering the Solution: ( (a, b, c) = (9, 11, -5) )\nIt appears O1-mini applied some threshold analysis to find pairs that sum to nearly 4, but without providing any details.\nThrough diligent testing, one solution stands out:\n\nCase ( k = 5 ):\n\nLet ( a = 9 ) and ( b = 11 ).\n\nSubstituting these values:\n(9 / (11 - 5)) + (11 / (9 - 5)) - (5 / (9 + 11)) = (9 / 6) + (11 / 4) - (5 / 20) = 1.5 + 2.75 - 0.25 = 4.0\nThe equation holds true, confirming that ( (9, 11, -5) ) is a valid solution."

    "text": "The Uniqueness of the Solution\nGiven the symmetry of the equation, any permutation of ( (9, 11, -5) ) will also satisfy the equation. These permutations include:\n\n( (11, -5, 9) )\n( (-5, 9, 11) )\n( (9, -5, 11) )\n( (11, 9, -5) )\n( (-5, 11, 9) )\n\nEach of these triples, when substituted into the equation, will yield a sum of 4, thereby satisfying the equation."
