This is a post about non-trivial **math** problem solved using **OpenAI O1-mini**.

# Solving a Symmetrical Diophantine Equation: AI Approach

Diophantine equations (DE), are polynomial equations with integer solutions. You probably remember from school:
$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$

This DE has a beautiful and simple collection of integer solutions. 

In this blog post, let's explore the symmetric equation without a known trivial solution. The best solution has over 100 digits!!!

$\frac{a}{b + c} + \frac{b}{a + c} + \frac{c}{a + b} = 4$

For more details, please see this math discussion:

A more recent math lecture discusses the hardness of finding small solutions:

[Cubic representation problem](https://ami.uni-eszterhazy.hu/uploads/papers/finalpdf/AMI_43_from29to41.pdf)

This equation is symmetric in its variables. Such symmetry often hints at potential strategies for finding solutions, as it allows us to assume certain relationships between the variables without loss of generality.


## Solution Generated by OpenAI O1-mini Reasoning LLM

The solution below is generated by the OpenAI O1-mini reasoning LLM system using the following prompt:

> **a/(b+c)+b/(a+c)+c/(a+b)=4**


No other AI model or LLM has been able to solve this problem!

## Breaking Down the Problem

To tackle this equation, we'll employ techniques commonly used in solving DE, such as symmetry exploitation, substitution, and systematic trial and error.

### Step 1: Leveraging Symmetry

Given the equation's symmetry, we can assume, without loss of generality, that one of the variables is negative.

### Step 2: Introducing Substitution

Let's assume \( c = -k \), where \( k \) is a positive integer. Substituting this into our original equation transforms it into:


$\frac{a}{b - k} + \frac{b}{a - k} - \frac{k}{a + b} = 4$


This substitution simplifies the problem by reducing the number of negative terms, making it easier to handle the equation's balance.

### Step 3: Systematic Trial and Error

With \( c = -k \), we now seek positive integers \( a \) and \( b \) such that \( a > k \) and \( b > k \) to avoid division by zero or negative denominators. Through systematic trial, varying \( k \) and solving for \( a \) and \( b \), we aim to satisfy the equation.

#### Discovering the Solution: \( (a, b, c) = (9, 11, -5) \)

It appears O1-mini applied some threshold analysis to find pairs that sum to nearly 4, but without providing any details.

Through diligent testing, one solution stands out:

- **Case \( k = 5 \):**
  
  - Let \( a = 9 \) and \( b = 11 \).
  
  Substituting these values:
  

  (9 / (11 - 5)) + (11 / (9 - 5)) - (5 / (9 + 11)) = (9 / 6) + (11 / 4) - (5 / 20) = 1.5 + 2.75 - 0.25 = 4.0

  
  The equation holds true, confirming that \( (9, 11, -5) \) is a valid solution.



## The Uniqueness of the Solution

Given the symmetry of the equation, any permutation of \( (9, 11, -5) \) will also satisfy the equation. These permutations include:

- \( (11, -5, 9) \)
- \( (-5, 9, 11) \)
- \( (9, -5, 11) \)
- \( (11, 9, -5) \)
- \( (-5, 11, 9) \)

Each of these triples, when substituted into the equation, will yield a sum of 4, thereby satisfying the equation.

## Conclusion

Through the exploration of a symmetrical Diophantine equation, we've unveiled a unique set of integer solutions: all permutations of \( (9, 11, -5) \). It is fascinating that AI can solve this now in few minutes when prompted carefully!
