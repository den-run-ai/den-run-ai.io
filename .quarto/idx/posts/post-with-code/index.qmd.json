Substituting this into our original equation transforms it into:\n\n\n$\\frac{a}{b - k} + \\frac{b}{a - k} - \\frac{k}{a + b} = 4$\n\n\nThis substitution simplifies the problem by reducing the number of negative terms, making it easier to handle the equation's balance.\n\n### Step 3: Systematic Trial and Error\n\nWith \\( c = -k \\), we now seek positive integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) such that \\( a > k \\) and \\( b > k \\) to avoid division by zero or negative denominators.
